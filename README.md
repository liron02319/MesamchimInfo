# MesamchimInfo
info
Today we are exposed and come across on social media, in the news and in the media, cases where private events were held where at the time of the event there were no guests or few guests, which had a negative effect on the mood of the owner of the event/shimcha and his family.
Sometimes, the owners of the event and their family do not know what to do or ask for help from outside parties in order to help in these cases.
Today there are people and groups who come across these situations and they come to these events and help in this situation. These groups are called "Mesamchim".
In addition, there are people who would like to help and be happy and even call their friends so that they can help as well.
The problem is that, apart from the first proximity, it is difficult to find out events from this type.
The purpose of the application is to gather all these people and all references to one place, that is, in the application the owner of the event or an associate on his behalf will be able to open a call for a request to recruit volunteers who will come to make happy.
In addition, people will also be able to choose the event they want to celebrate.
In addition, the application allows you to open a call for a request to a funeral or events of this type.
